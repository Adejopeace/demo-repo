    <h2> Ben Carson: American neurosurgeon and politician </h2>
   <p><b>Ben carson</b>, in full <b> Benjamin Solomon Carson, Sr. </b>, (born September 18, 1951, 
       Detroit, Michigan, U.S.),<br> American politician and neurosurgeon 
       who performed the first successful separation of conjoined twins <br> who were
        attached at the back of the head (occipital craniopagus twins). <br> 
        The operation, which took place in 1987, lasted some 22 hours and involved
         a 70-member surgical team. <br> Carson also refined a technique known as 
         hemispherectomy, in which one-half of the brain is removed to prevent 
         seizures in persons with severe epilepsy. <br> He later became active in
          politics and served as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development 
        in the administration of U.S. Pres. Donald Trump <br> <br> <br>

        <h4>Early life and Medical career</h4>
        Carson spent his early childhood in Detroit. <br>
        His parents divorced when he was eight years old, 
        and thereafter he lived with his mother and brother,<br> 
        spending a brief period in Boston and later returning to Detroit. <br>
         Although Carson showed potential as a student, he performed poorly in school <br> until his mother 
         challenged him and his brother with reading and writing assignments
          in addition to their regular schoolwork. <br> Carson developed a newfound
           interest in learning and eventually earned a scholarship to Yale University, <br>
            receiving a bachelor’s degree in psychology in 1973.

             While at Yale, he met 
            Lacena (“Candy”) Rustin; the couple married in 1975 and had three children. <br>
             He next attended the University of Michigan, earning a medical degree in 1977,<br>
             and later Johns Hopkins University Medical School in Baltimore, Maryland, 
             
             where he completed a residency in neurosurgery. <br>  In 1984,
              after a brief 
             stint as a senior registrar in neurosurgery at the Sir 
             Charles Gairdner Hospital, <br> part of the Queen Elizabeth II Medical
              Center in Nedlands, Western Australia, Carson became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. <br> He was one 
             of the youngest doctors in the United States to earn such a title. 
             <br> He later also held professorships in plastic surgery,
         oncology, and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins. <br>
