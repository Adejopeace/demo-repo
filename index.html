        <p > <i> I started this class by January and 
            I will be sharing what I have experienced so far. 
            I would like to commend the mentors for a job well done <br>
            Actually there are alot of developers out there,
             that the idea of training others or giving back to the society never comes to their mind,<br>
              but thank God for people like these mentors , they found out of their busy schedule to give to the society ,<br>
             they deserves accolades for that. <br> </i>

        <p> <i>
           Well I don't have alot of experience to share, since we just started the class <br>
           I get to know about the fundamentals,how the computer,internet works,<br>
           i know the basic terms and through this class I found coding very intersting <br>
           and the most interesting of it is that i understand ,everything that is going on in the class <br>
           even when I missed the class,when I come online and I check the previous messages I understand what they did previously <br>
           am saying this because, there is another online class am attending but to be sincere <br>
           I don't know what is going on in the class.   </i>
        </p>   
        <p> <i>
            Well it is just short note,if not ,I can continue to write and write <br>
            I will like to say thank you,thanks for your time, your resourses, we are grateful.</i>
